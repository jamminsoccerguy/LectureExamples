// Complex3App.java

// This driver program uses the Complex3.java class.
// The variables within Complex3 canNOT be accessed directly
// because they have now been declared as private within Complex3.
// So, access to the information within Complex3 objects is done
// via the accessor methods (see Complex3.java).

// Note: this main driver would be very nice inside the Complex3.java
// class as a test driver, thus eliminating the need for this separate
// file and class.  However, the use of a separate file shows how a
// class from another file can be utilized externally.
